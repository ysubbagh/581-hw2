I created a virtual enviroment to avoid conflicts with other more up to date packages I have. After downloading all the neccessary packages and correct versions, some modifications to the syntax and logic of the code needed to be modified to run. After everything was running properly and running the neccesary files I got the images below for the 4 original cusines."
